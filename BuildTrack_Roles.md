# Azimuth BuildTrack — Roles & Responsibilities

**One app, role-based access.** Every user logs into the same app. The **Admin** creates each user's ID and assigns a role — the app then opens straight to that role's own set of screens. Nobody sees more than their role needs (e.g. Workshop can't see costs, Client can't see vendors).

Design language is consistent across all roles: warm beige canvas, cream cards, candy-coloured status pills, lime accent, and a floating pill navigation bar with a prominent action button.

## 📋 Project Manager

**Who:** Owns delivery of a set of assigned builds.

**Owns & manages**
- Timelines & milestones for assigned projects
- Task assignment to workshop/design members
- Workshop bay & resource allocation
- Delays: tag reason, reschedule, see cascade impact
- Approving stage completions submitted by workshop

**How they work:** Reviews "needs you today" (approvals + at-risk), assigns stages to team members with dates, manages the weekly schedule and bays, and keeps builds on track.

**Screens (9):** Dashboard (my builds) · My Projects · Project detail (with assignees) · **Assign Task** · Schedule & bays · Team workload · Approvals · Notifications · Profile

**Features**
- My builds status + today's focus
- Assign task: pick member + set start/due dates
- Schedule: workshop bay allocation + this week's stages

## 🛒 Procurement

**Who:** Orders all materials and equipment; manages vendors. *(Core of Hero Feature #1 — never miss a lead time.)*

**Owns & manages**
- "To-Order" list driven by auto-calculated order-by dates
- Purchase Orders (ordered → dispatched → received)
- Vendors, their lead-times and reliability scores
- Goods receipt handoff to Store

**How they work:** Opens to order-by alerts (order today / X days left), creates POs to vendors, tracks dispatch/receipt, and watches vendor performance.

**Screens (9):** To-Order (dashboard) · Purchase Orders · PO detail (status tracker) · **Create PO** · Receive / GRN · Vendors · Vendor detail · Notifications · Profile

**Features**
- Backward-scheduled order-by alerts + escalation

## 🔧 Workshop / Fabrication

**Who:** The people physically building the truck. Mobile-first, on the floor. *(Core of Hero Feature #2 — traceability capture.)*

**Owns & manages**
- Their assigned stages/tasks only
- Progress photos
- Confirming each part **installed** into the truck (scan serial → linked to truck + stage). Bill/warranty are **not** re-entered here — Store already captured them at intake.
- Submitting completed stages for PM approval

**How they work:** Big-button, offline-friendly screens. Opens their current task, updates a checklist, adds photos, scans & logs each component, and marks the stage complete.

**Screens (9):** My Tasks · Task detail (checklist) · Add photo · **Scan to install** · Components (installed) · Mark complete · My week · Notifications · Profile

**Features**
- My tasks (in-progress + up next) with offline sync
- Stage checklist + progress
- Add progress photo (works offline)
- **Scan to install**: scan a part's serial → it matches a component already logged by Store (bill on file) → confirm it's installed in this truck & stage
- Mark stage complete → sends to PM for approval

> **Store vs Workshop (clear split):** **Store** creates the component record — serial + bill + warranty — when goods arrive. **Workshop** only *scans to install* — linking that existing record to the truck & stage. No duplicate data entry.

**Sees:** only their tasks. **Cannot:** see fleet data, costs, vendors.

**Screens (9):** Inbox · Receive / GRN · Log component · Inventory · Components (search) · Component detail · **Recall check** · Notifications · Profile

**Features**
- Goods receipt with item verification (qty check)
- Log component: serial + bill + warranty + assign to build

- Their documents
- Raising post-delivery requests

**How they work:** Opens to a big progress ring and current status, browses build photos, approves designs, downloads documents, and can raise a request any time.

## How the roles connect (a build's flow)

1. **Admin** onboards the project → app auto-builds the timeline & order-by dates.
2. **Design** creates the layout → **Client** approves it.
3. **Procurement** gets order-by alerts → creates POs → items arrive.
4. **Store** receives & logs each part (serial + bill + warranty).
5. **PM** assigns stages → **Workshop** builds, logs parts, submits for approval.
6. **PM** approves stages; **Client** watches progress + photos live.
7. On delivery, **Store** generates the handover pack (all bills/warranties).
8. Post-delivery, **Client** raises tickets → **Service** resolves (warranty-linked).
9. If a part is faulty, **Store** runs a **recall check** across the whole fleet.
